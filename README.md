# OAuth 2.0 Educational Tools

This repository contains a set of web-based tools for conducting authorization flows "manually" using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. These tools are intended to be used for educational purposes only and are not considered secure. Be cautious with access tokens and refresh tokens that are generated by these tools.

Presently, the following tools are available:

1. [Authorization Request Helper](https://friendsbaltcs.github.io/OAuth-Tools/helper/)
2. [Authorization Redirect Helper](https://friendsbaltcs.github.io/OAuth-Tools/helper/redirect/)

Note: these tools presently work only with the authorization code grant type. Features are optimized for the Google OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect endpoints, but other arbitrary endpoints can be used as well. The Auth URL is fully customizable; however the token request may need to be customized and run manually through cURL or another tool.
